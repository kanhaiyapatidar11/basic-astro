            Planets are constantly in motion with respect to earth in the skies. The positions of
            <em>Sun, Moon and some planets</em> close to earth can give important clues about the
            fortunes of individual human beings and groups of human beings. That is the basic
            premise of <strong>astrology</strong>.

        <p> How exactly we can make guesses about the fortunes of
            individual human beings and groups of human beings based on the positions of those
            planets in the skies is the question that we will attempt to answer in this website. While
            astrology is the subject that deals with this question, there are many theories and
            philosophies in vogue and they are significantly different from each other.
