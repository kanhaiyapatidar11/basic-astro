    <h3 id="sun">Sun :</h3>
    <section>
        <img src="image/planets/sun-2579561.jpg" alt="Sun" height="128" width="128">
        <p>The sun is your identity. It is the essence that you shine out into the world. It represents the vital
            force
            that drives you to seek the highest expression of your true self. Your sun sign is how you answer the
            question “I am” and how you experience life and express your individuality.
        </p>
    </section>
    <h3 id="moon">Moon :</h3>
    <section>
        <img src="image/planets/moon-2579522.jpg" alt="Moon" height="128" width="128">
        <p>The moon is the soul behind your identity. It is the subconscious side of yourself that you typically
            keep
            hidden and is the driving force behind your emotional reactions. Your moon sign helps you feel pleasure
            and
            pain, joy and sorrow, and gives insight into how you nurture and restore yourself. </p>
    </section>
    <h3 id="mars">Mars :</h3>
    <section>
        <img src="image/planets/mars-2554146.jpg" alt="Mars" height="128" width="128">
        <p>Mars is the planet of energy, action, and desire. It is the survival instinct and can be thought of as
            the
            “leftover” animal nature of man. Mars rules our animal instincts for aggression, anger, and survival.
        </p>
    </section>
    <h3 id="mercury">Mercury :</h3>
    <section>
        <img src="image/planets/mercury-2590722.jpg" alt="Mercury" height="128" width="128">
        <p>Mercury is the planet of communication, intellect, memory, and transportation. Your Mercury sign
            influences
            all these traits, like whether you're a triple texter, if you use an Excel spreadsheet to plan every
            weekend
            trip or just go with the flow, and which Wikipedia pages you spend hours reading.
        </p>
    </section>
    <h3 id="saturn">Saturn :</h3>
    <section>
        <img src="image/planets/saturn-2554489.jpg" alt="Saturn" height="128" width="128">
        <p>Saturn is all about your moral obligations and authority. It comes up in the way you handle
            responsibility,
            create boundaries, and do other adulting activities in life. Therefore, knowing what your Saturn sign
            means
            will help you understand how it plays into your daily routine
        </p>
    </section>
    <h3 id="jupiter">Jupiter :</h3>
    <section>
        <img src="image/planets/jupiter-2676538.jpg" alt="Jupiter" height="128" width="128">
        <p>Jupiter is known as the planet of good fortune, abundance, and knowledge. The giant yellow planet brings
            us
            optimism, opportunity, intellectual stimulation, and good luck.</p>
    </section>
    <h3 id="venus">Venus :</h3>
    <section>
        <img src="image/planets/venus-2721120.jpg" alt="Venus" height="128" width="128">
        <p>The planet of love, romance, money, beauty, and art, your natal Venus speaks to the way you express your
            desires, your passions, what you value, and how you relate to and experience pleasure. It also
            influences
            how you socialize, relate to, and attract others.</p>
    </section>
    <h3 id="rahu">Rahu :</h3>
    <section>
        <p>Rahu represents materialism, mischief, fear, dissatisfaction, obsession and confusion. Rahu is also
            associated with politicians and occult sciences. Like Ketu, Rahu is also an enemy against the sun and
            moon.
            It is generally considered as a malefic planet in astrology.</p>
    </section>
    <h3 id="ketu">Ketu :</h3>
    <section>
        <p>Ketu is believed to bring prosperity to the devotee's family, removes the effects of snakebite and
            illness
            arising out of poisons. He grants good health, wealth and cattle to his devotees. </p>
